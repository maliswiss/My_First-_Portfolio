      <h2>about me</h2>
      <p>
        I have been living in Switzerland for 2.5 years. Nature, culture and
        universal human values are wonderful in this country..

        I have decided to transition my career into the IT field, and this
        process has been incredibly exciting for me. After working in a
        different industry for several years, stepping into the world of
        information technologies offers continuous opportunities for learning
        and development. Initially, this change might seem like a courageous
        move, but the IT sector has proven to be worthwhile with its various
        specializations and engaging projects. Currently, I find myself
        acquiring new skills and evolving in this dynamic field. I believe that
        this shift will open many doors for me in my future career, and I am
        filled with enthusiasm for the opportunities this journey brings.
